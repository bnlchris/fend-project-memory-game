## About

This coding project is a part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s Front-End Nanodegree program.

The task for me as a student was to create a classic Memory Game. Some HTML and CSS code was given, the JavaScript code had to be written by me.

## Instructions

The classic Memory game consists of a set of cards. Each item on the cards comes as a pair. The player's objective is to find all pairs of cards, the less tries the better.

To play, just click any card on the deck. It will flip and show it's icon. Try to find the corresponding icon within the other cards now.

Each time you flip two cards the number of moves will increase by one.

When all pairs have been found a message will pop up, showing the total number of moves and the time it took the player to finish the game

##Resources

For the JavaScript Code, I used a given function to shuffle the cards radomly. The original code can he found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976).
