## Instructions

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. My task, primarily, was to write the JavaScript code.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Explanations

The classic Memory game consists of a set of cards. Each item on the cards comes as a pair. The player's objective is to find all pairs of cards, the less tries the better.
